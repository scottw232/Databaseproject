The purpose of this project is to analyze, specify, design, implement, document, and demonstrate an app your team
develops. The project follows the three phases outlined in the Database Application Development Methodology:
Analysis & Specification, Design, and Implementation. The implementation must use a fully relational, distinct Database
Management System (DBMS) that utilizes tables and supports standard SQL queries. Embedded databases (such as
SQLite) may not be used. Tools that generate SQL, map programming objects to database objects, or non-tabular
systems that utilize SQL as a data manipulation language are also not permitted. Additional details regarding acceptable
project stacks will be communicated in the assignment directions for the project.
